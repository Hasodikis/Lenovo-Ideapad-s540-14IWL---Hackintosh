# This is about an installation of Mac Os X on a Lenovo Ideapad s540-14IWL. 
The specs of the machine are as follows:
(CPU) Intel Core i5-8265U
IPS Panel 14 "
1920x1080
RAM 8 GB DDR4
Intel UHD Graphics 620
SSD 256 GB (and a second added by me) 
Card Reader
Bluetooth, HDMI, USB 3.1, USB-C, Wi-Fi
fingerprint sensor.

It is still a work in progress but so far.... 
everything works except of 
1. firgerprint sensor (which will never work) 
2. HDMI which is in progress. 
3. Wifi - bluetooth, since I haven' t received the replacement card yet.

However, the most serious problem so far is the touchpad(VoodooI2C), which works perfectly well apart of a strange input issue.
Saddly this problem consumes a lot of power due to cpu usage (for the issue see here: https://github.com/alexandred/VoodooI2C/issues/250)  

Bear in mind that I am novice and my coding skills are next to zero. 
Therefor you will probably find a lot of errors in the files and I will probably need your help way more than my abillity to answer to any questions.

Finaly, this whole project would not be possible whithout the help and patience of marianopela (https://github.com/marianopela/Lenovo-Ideapad-S540-14IML-Hackintosh).
